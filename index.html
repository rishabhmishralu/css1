    <h3>what is CSS?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Css stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li><br>
        <li>CSS describe how HTML elemnts are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><span id="overline">CSS is not neccesary</span><span class="color"> CSS save a lot of work.</span> can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <br>
    <i>
<li >External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li></i>
    <br>
    </ol>
     <H3 >CSS can bw added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</H3>
     <ul>
       <li> inline - by  using the style attribute inside HTML element</li>
<li>internal -by using a style element in the head section </li>
<li>External- by using a link element to link to a external CSS file</li>
<li>the most common way to add CSS , is to keep the style in external CSS files.however, <span class="color"> this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles </span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and the easier for you to try it yourself</li>
     </ul>
     <p> when comparing CSS class vs ID , the difference is that CSS class applies a styles to multiple elements .ID,on the other hand applies to one unique element . ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript</p>
<p> in CSS ,selector is are use to target aecific element or range of elements on a web page . once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the  element </p>
<p>there is a wide range of selectors available. two of most commonly used are class and ID. both are used to target elements to which is style should be applied.</p>
